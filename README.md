# Minecraft PE for PSP

This repository contains a port of **Minecraft Pocket Edition** to the Sony
PlayStation Portable. It runs on **every PSP model, including the 32 MB
PSP-1000** — see [Hardware](#hardware) for what the 1000 gives up.

The base is MCPE **0.6.1** — that is where the world logic, the save format and
most of the code come from — but the feature set has since grown past it, piece
by piece, and now sits at roughly **MCPE 0.7.6**: world generation, survival and
creative, mobs, crafting, furnaces, chests, armor, TNT, the Nether Reactor,
buckets, fire and flint & steel, signs, paintings, beds and day/night, the
tripod camera, sounds and saving. There are probably still some bugs.

## About the port

This is a **source-based port, not the source code itself.** The gameplay and
world logic are ported piece by piece from the original MCPE sources — 0.6.1
first, then later versions for the features 0.6.1 never had — and adapted for
the PSP, but the engine underneath is different where the hardware needs it to
be.

The biggest difference is how the map is kept in memory. MCPE holds the world
as a cache of separate chunk objects, each carrying its own block, data and
light arrays. Here the whole fixed 256×128×256 world is resident at once, so
all three had to get much smaller than a byte per block. None of them is a flat
array any more — each one pages in only the parts of the world that carry
information:

- `blocks` — block IDs in **16×16×16 sections**, the scheme Minecraft's console
  edition uses. A section that is a single ID (all air above the surface, solid
  stone below) is just that ID and costs nothing. Anything else gets a page:
  **4 bits per block** indexing a 16-entry palette, or a full byte per block if
  that section really does hold more than 16 block types — so there is no limit
  on what you can build in one place, it just costs more there. Measured across
  real saved worlds, 8 MB becomes 2.3–2.9 MB.
- `data` — block metadata at **4 bits per block**, stored sparsely: one 64-byte
  page per column, allocated on the first non-zero write. Measured on real
  worlds, ~95% of columns never hold any metadata at all, so 4 MB becomes
  about 0.6 MB.
- `light` — sky and block light as **16×16 horizontal planes** with a sentinel
  index, also from the console edition. About 95% of sky planes and 80% of
  block-light planes are uniform (all dark or all lit) and cost one index entry
  instead of a page, so 8 MB becomes under 1 MB.

Together that is roughly 20 MB of world down to about 4 MB, which is what makes
the whole map fit on a 32 MB PSP alongside the meshes.

The world is generated once at load around the spawn point, and the rest builds
lazily as you walk toward it. Only the mesh columns near the camera are drawn.
So it is the same *fixed* MCPE world, just held and streamed differently.

## Building

Make sure you have the [PSPDEV](https://github.com/pspdev/pspdev) toolchain on
your `PATH`, then:

```
make clean && make
```

This produces `EBOOT.PBP`. To get a ready-to-copy folder instead:

```
make dist
```

Header dependencies are tracked, so editing a `.h` rebuilds everything that
includes it — a plain `make` is enough after the first build.

## Running

**On a PSP** — copy onto the memory stick so you have:

```
PSP/GAME/MCPSP/EBOOT.PBP
PSP/GAME/MCPSP/data/
```

and launch it from the Game menu. Worlds save into a `saves/` folder created
next to the EBOOT.

**In PPSSPP** — just open `EBOOT.PBP`.

Keep `EBOOT.PBP` and `data/` together; textures and sounds load from `data/`
next to the EBOOT.

## DualShock 3

Options > Controls > Control Scheme > **Layout 4** puts the camera on the right
stick and gives every action its own button — place and break on L2/R2, the
hotbar on L1/R1, crafting and inventory on Square/Triangle, third person and
sneak on the stick clicks. It needs a DualShock 3 paired to the PSP, and it
needs a plugin:

**[VanillaDS3Remapper](https://github.com/rereprep/VanillaDS3Remapper)** —
Total_Noob's DS3Remapper. Not shipped with this port: grab `DS3Remapper.prx`
from there, drop it in `seplugins/` on the memory stick and enable it
(`ms0:/seplugins/game.txt`, line `ms0:/seplugins/DS3Remapper.prx 1`).

Without it the extra inputs do not exist as far as any game is concerned. Read
through plain `sceCtrlReadBufferPositive` a DualShock is aliased onto a PSP pad:
L1 and L2 both return `0x100`, and the stick clicks and the right stick are
simply gone. The extra buttons live in ctrl.prx's EXTENDED report, which that
call never asks for; the plugin hooks the service and asks for it.

The port does not require the plugin and never refuses to run without one: with
no controller in sight Layout 4 is greyed in the Controls page and quietly plays
as Layout 1, and it starts working by itself the moment the pad turns up. A
saved Layout 4 survives a boot on a plain PSP.

## Hardware

Every PSP model runs it, but the 32 MB machines (PSP-1000, the original "Phat")
have half the memory of everything later, and the world plus its meshes still
take most of the heap. The port measures the machine's user memory at boot —
heap plus what the kernel still holds, so a fragmented heap cannot make a 3000
look like a 1000 — and on the smaller one it starts smaller:

- **View distance** — Tiny and Short only, out of Tiny / Short / Normal / Far,
  and it starts on Tiny. Short is fine on most worlds; heavy caves and lava run
  the heap to the edge, where distant sections simply stop building until you
  get closer.
- **Sound** — a half-rate pack (11 kHz instead of 22 kHz). It is audibly
  grainier through the speaker and saves 0.8 MB.

Same world size, same generation, same gameplay, same save files either way. A
PSP-2000 or later (and an emulator) gets the full-size sound pack and all four
view distances.

## Compatibility

Worlds use the real MCPE 0.6.1 on-disk format (`chunks.dat`, `level.dat`,
`entities.dat`). A world made on the PSP opens in MCPE 0.6.1, and a world copied
off a phone opens on the PSP.

## Disclaimer

This is unofficial homebrew, run at your own risk. It comes with **no warranty
of any kind** — see the license below, which says the same in legal words.

I am not responsible for anything that happens to your console, your memory
stick, your save files or anything else while running it. That covers a console
that stops working, data you lose, and a warranty you void by running homebrew at
all. Running unsigned software on a PSP is something you choose to do, and the
consequences are yours.

Practical version, because most of the risk here is boring and avoidable:

- **Back up your worlds.** They are plain files in `saves/` next to the EBOOT —
  copy them off the stick before updating. This port is still being worked on and
  a bug that corrupts a save is a real possibility.
- **Copy, don't move.** Keep the archive you installed from, so a bad update is a
  matter of putting the old folder back.
- Nothing here writes outside its own folder and `ms0:/PSP/PHOTO` (the camera),
  and nothing touches firmware — but that is what the code does today, not a
  promise about every build.

If something does go wrong, open an issue with what happened and on which PSP
model; that is worth more than a warning nobody reads.

## Credits

- Gameplay and world logic ported from the Minecraft Pocket Edition sources
  (0.6.1 as the base, later versions for the newer features).
- [**MCPE-0.8.1**](https://github.com/oldminecraftcommunity/MCPE-0.8.1) — the
  0.8.1 decompilation, used as a source for the features 0.6.1 never had.
- [**Oreo**](https://github.com/Oreo80) — helped with the porting.
- [**CODINGBOTSTUDIO**](https://github.com/CODINGBOTSTUDIO) — contributed the
  code the 3D clouds are based on, and found the leak in `CompoundTag`'s put*,
  which dropped the tag already under a key instead of freeing it. Also spotted
  that exiting the app (HOME/START) skipped the world/player teardown that
  quitting to the menu does, that `worldFree` never cleared
  `preservedTileEntities`, and that world teardown terminated the chunk
  generation worker instead of waiting for it, which can strand the allocator
  lock.
- [**CYEVV**](https://github.com/CYEVV) — helped fix in-game buttons that were
  not rendering with the 4444 texture format.
- [**SzyZET777**](https://github.com/SzyZET777) — pointed out that the
  player-edit fast lane in `dirty.cpp` was open-coding the same shift loop at
  four call sites, each keeping the membership array in sync by hand. The queue
  stayed a fixed array (it is pushed to from the light cascade, which can run
  while the worldgen worker is inside the allocator — under `-fno-exceptions` a
  container that has to grow there corrupts the heap silently), but the index
  arithmetic moved into `editQueueRemoveAt` / `editQueuePushFront` /
  `editQueueFind`. Reading it properly is also what turned up `evict()` not
  clearing the queue: entries key on the resident *slot*, so one outliving its
  chunk blocked the next chunk's edits from the fast lane.
- [**Stann**](https://github.com/ThatStann) — drew the delete-world **X** button
  (both states, in `touchgui.png`), the controller drawings the Controls page
  labels (`data/images/gui/controls/psp.png`, `go.png`), and the button-icon
  sheet the in-game hint row is built from (`data/images/gui/tooltips.png`) —
  every button in a pressed and a released state, the DualShock's shoulders,
  sticks and PlayStation Start/Select included. Also spotted the uneven border
  widths on the world-type pills that turned out to be a fractional nine-patch
  corner.
- **Total_Noob** — **DS3Remapper**, the plugin that makes a DualShock's extra
  buttons and its right stick reach a game at all. Not bundled here; it lives at
  [rereprep/VanillaDS3Remapper](https://github.com/rereprep/VanillaDS3Remapper)
  under its own GPLv3, and Layout 4 needs it (see [DualShock 3](#dualshock-3)).

### PSP engines this port learned from

- [**DaedalusX64**](https://github.com/DaedalusX64/daedalus) — the N64 emulator
  for PSP, and the sharpest PSP renderer to read. `src/util/fast_memcpy.cpp` is
  its `memcpy_vfpu` (`Source/SysPSP/Utility/FastMemcpyPSP.cpp`, © 2009 Raphael,
  modified by Corn) copied essentially verbatim; Daedalus is
  GPL-2.0-**or-later**, so it is carried here under GPLv3. Two of its practices
  were adopted rather than copied: composing simple model matrices by hand
  instead of paying the `sceGum*` stack for them
  (`Source/SysPSP/HLEGraphics/RendererPSP.cpp` uses no `sceGum*` at all), and
  writing D-cache ranges back **without** invalidating them when the reader is
  the GE (`NativeTexturePSP.cpp` writes back for textures and keeps
  invalidate for the audio path, where the CPU is the one reading).
